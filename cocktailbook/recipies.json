Not long after the recruitment, a recipe for the Clover Club cocktail was published in the New York Press.",

Women started enjoying cocktails like never before, and the pink-colored Clover Club became a popular choice. It was so popular that its history as a drink invented in a men's club was forgotten."

The cocktail is said to have been invented by officers of the military force of the British East India Company in the 1700s. The British East India Company was the first company to import quinine to Europe, which was used to treat malaria. The quinine was very bitter, so the British East India Company mixed it with sugar, water, lime, and gin to make it more palatable. This was the birth of the Gin & Tonic.",

The Gin & Tonic is a very simple cocktail, but it is very refreshing and easy to make. It is also a very versatile cocktail, and you can make it with many different gins and tonics or even add flavorings as different syrups or liqueurs. You can also add different garnishes to make it more interesting."

As with many other cocktails, the name comes from an old saying. However, the connection between the drink and the ocean and sailing is well documented.",

The Dark 'n Stormy was born, and it quickly became the national drink of Bermuda."

The modern cocktail has changed a bit from the original recipe, it uses simple syrup and real lemon juice. Most bartenders today also use 1/2 oz bourbon and just a 1.5 oz amaretto, there is almost always added an egg white to give the cocktail a nice foam and mouthfeel.",

The cocktail is very well balanced, and the egg white and cream give it a nice texture.",
